## File Structure
Standard file structure for python packages as follows:  
* `<main folder name>`
  * `docs/`  
    * **[LICENSE.txt](../docs/LICENSE.txt)**
    * **[README.md](../docs/LICENSE.txt)**         <- _`.rst` file type preferred in python, but `.md` is more common overall_
  * `src/`  <- _dedicated src is not always done but recommended for compatibility_
    * `<module_name>`       <- _often the same name as the main folder, but should be a subfolder_
      * `__init__.py`       <- _an empty file can be all that's needed at times. However, importing items here can be useful as they will be accessible to any file that is importing the overall module_ 
      * `_version.py`       <- _autogenerated by versioneer using info from `setup.cfg` [^1]_
      * `main.py`           <- _entry point file to be run_
      * `utils.py`
      * `<any other python files>`
  * **[versioneer.py](../versioneer.py)**         <- _must be here in the top level folder [^1]_
  * **[setup.py](../setup.py)**                   <- _must be here in the top level folder_ [^2]
  * **[setup.cfg](../setup.cfg)**                 <- _must be here in the top level folder_ [^2] 
  * **[requirements.txt](../requirements.txt)**   <- _must be here in the top level folder_ [^3]
  * **[MANIFEST.in](../MANIFEST.in)**             <- _not strictly required_
  * `build/`      <- _optional_
  * `data/`       <- _optional, can include .csv, .jpg, etc files for the code to access_
  * `dist/`       <- _optional, would usually contain .egg, .whl, .tar.gz, etc files_
  * `examples/`   <- _optional_
  * `lib/`        <- _optional_
  * `scripts/`    <- _optional, would contain `.sh` files in linux/mac_
  * `tests/`      <- _optional, would contain python flies_
  

[^1]: Unlike `versioneer.py`, the file `_version.py` does not have to be inside the top level folder. I prefer  putting it within `src/<module>/` so that it does not clutter the top level directory and so that is more easily accessible within the project. For this to work, `setup.cfg` should be updated so that the versioneer arguments are set to the file path `src/<module>/`, which is where I recommend  putting `_version.py`.  
[^2]: Some applications use only one- a `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`, but versioneer prefers both.    
[^3]: Can be autogenerated by PyCharm. Will not be blank as must have versioneer at least.
